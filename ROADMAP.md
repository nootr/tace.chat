# tace.chat Production Roadmap

> **Current Status**: Research/Educational Platform (Production Score: 4/10)  
> **Target**: Production-ready decentralized messaging platform

## Project Overview

tace.chat is a decentralized, end-to-end encrypted messaging platform that eliminates central servers by storing messages temporarily in a Chord distributed hash table (DHT). Users communicate through a web browser interface, with messages encrypted client-side and stored across a network of independent nodes.

**Key Innovation**: No central authority required - users' public keys serve as their identities, and the DHT network provides message routing and temporary storage without any party being able to read message contents.

## Current Implementation Strengths

- ✅ **Robust cryptographic foundation** (P-256 ECDSA + ECDH + AES-256-GCM)
- ✅ **Sophisticated Chord DHT** with virtual nodes, replication, and load balancing
- ✅ **Complete working system** from browser client to distributed storage
- ✅ **Strong privacy guarantees** - node operators cannot read messages
- ✅ **Comprehensive test coverage** for core crypto and DHT operations
- ✅ **Container deployment** with Docker and Kubernetes configurations

## Current Limitations

**User Experience:**
- Polling-based messaging (no real-time delivery)
- Manual contact exchange (no discovery mechanism)
- Temporary message storage (messages may be lost)
- Complex setup for new users

**Operational:**
- In-memory data storage (no persistence)
- Limited monitoring and observability
- Manual scaling and maintenance

**Security:**
- Basic rate limiting only
- No protection against targeted DoS attacks
- Metadata analysis possible through traffic correlation
